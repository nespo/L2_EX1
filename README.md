# Kotlin Higher-Order Functions Practice

## Description

This is a simple Kotlin console program created to practice using common higher-order functions.

It starts with a list of integers from 1 to 20 and then performs the following operations:

* **`filter`**: Extracts all the even numbers.
* **`map`**: Creates a new list containing the square of each original number.
* **`reduce`**: Calculates the total sum of all numbers in the original list.

The program then prints the results of these three operations to the console.

## How to Run

You can copy and paste the code from `Main.kt` into the [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) and run it there.
